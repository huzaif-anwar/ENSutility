Detailed steps to set up the project:
Prerequisites:
Some general prerequisites you might need for setting up a Python project. You can modify them according to your specific project requirements:
1.	Python: The project requires Python to be installed on your machine. The required version should be specified (for example, Python 3.7 or above).
2.	PyCharm: This guide assumes you are using PyCharm as your IDE. If you're not, you can download it from here.
3.	Git: You need Git installed on your machine to clone the project repository. If it's not already installed, you can download it from here.
4.	Access to the Repository: You need access to the project's Git repository. If you don't have access, you should request it from the project administrator.
5.	Basic Knowledge: You should have a basic understanding of using the command line, as well as a basic understanding of Python and Git.
Please ensure all these prerequisites are met before proceeding with the project setup.


Pycharm IDE:
the steps to set up the project using PyCharm IDE:
1.	Pull the Code: Open PyCharm, click on VCS in the menu, then Get from Version Control.... In the URL field, enter the URL of your repository and click Clone.
2.	Create a Virtual Environment: Once the project is cloned, go to File -> Settings -> Project: your-project-name -> Python Interpreter. Click on the gear icon, select Add..., in the left pane select Virtualenv Environment, then select a location for the new virtual environment in the right pane. Click OK.
3.	Install the Requirements: PyCharm should automatically detect the requirements.txt file and prompt you to install the requirements. If it doesn't, you can manually install them by opening the Terminal pane at the bottom of the PyCharm window and running:
pip install -r requirements.txt
After following these steps, your team should have a working copy of the project on their local machine, complete with all the necessary dependencies, using PyCharm.


Without IDE:
the detailed steps your team should follow to set up the project:
1.	Pull the Code: First, they need to clone the repository to their local machine. They can do this by opening a terminal and running the following command (replace your-repo-url with the actual URL of your repository):
git clone your-repo-url
2.	Navigate to the Project Directory: Change the current working directory to the project directory (replace your-project-name with the actual name of your project):
cd your-project-name
3.	Create a Virtual Environment: They should create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies. If they're using Python, they can do this using venv. Here's how:
python -m venv env
This will create a new virtual environment named env in the current directory.
4.	Activate the Virtual Environment: Before they can start installing packages, they need to activate the virtual environment. On Windows, they can do this with:
.\env\Scripts\activate
On Unix or MacOS, they should use:
source env/bin/activate
5.	Install the Requirements: Now they can install the project dependencies. These should be listed in a requirements.txt file in the project directory. They can install all the required packages with:
pip install -r requirements.txt
After following these steps, your team should have a working copy of the project on their local machine, complete with all the necessary dependencies.
